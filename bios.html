                    Pat "Pat By-ro-ny" - Lead Vocals & Guitar
                </h3>
                <p>
                    With a vocal range that makes Axl Rose weep into his morning supermodels, Pat is the undeniable voice of Defyance. 
                    With a stage presence so formidable that audiences have been known to spontaneously combust, Pat politely requests attention with every note he sings.
                    <br /><br/>
                    Except F#. He never hits F# on purpose.
                    <br /><br/>
                    When not fronting the band, Pat enjoys long walks on the beach, candlelit dinners, and gazing lovingly into your girlfriend's <span class="line-through">thighs</span> eyes.

                    Jeff "Ricky "Not Ricky Rocket" Rock" - Drums & Backing Vocals
                </h3>
                <p>
                    As Defyance's rhythm maestro, Ricky's drumming style is a unique blend of precision and chaos, much like a tornado in a watch factory.
                    His energetic performances often leave audiences wondering if they're witnessing a musical genius or a wild animal possessed by the spirit of another, wilder animal.
                    When not behind the drum kit, Ricky enjoys feeding perfectly healthy trees into wood chippers and attempting to stop his pet parrot from sinning, like, <i>all the time</i>.

                    Josh "Air Hammer" - Bass & Backing Vocals
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Josh emerged from a decades-long slumber under a pile of Iron Maiden CDs and rotting leaves when Ricky stopped for a piss while hunting a new drum kit in Minnesota's iron range.
                    With bass guitar in hand and an encyclopedic knowledge of 80s metal trivia, he quickly proved to be an invaluable addition to Defyance. 
                    When not laying down thunderous bass lines, Josh enjoys being confused by his own shadow and attempting human speech.<br /><br /><b><i class="centered-quote">It's not going well.</i></b>

                <h3>
                    "King" Brett - Guitar
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The newest member of Defyance, Brett has a mastery of the fretboard that makes Steve Vai question his life choices. 
                Known for making the most mind-bending solos look easier than tying shoelaces, Brett is currently under observation for narcolepsy, although he insists it's just "extreme relaxation techniques".
                When not metaphorically setting his fretboard on fire, Brett enjoys literally setting his fretboard on fire, collecting vintage pocket lint, and not even trying to understand NFTs.
